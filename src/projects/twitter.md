Create a <strong className="color-blue">Twitter</strong> clone that lets user accounts <strong className="color-purple">post public messages</strong>.

## Brief

Twitter is one of a few social media giants that have captivated the world. Every day there’s about a half of one billion tweets that get published between everyone’s feeds. But what if we want our own private Twitter where we keep our data?

## Level 1

The main differentiator is Twitter is made up of a bunch of short messages that represent someone’s expression at a moment in time.

Create a page of short messages that you can dynmically add new content with a database.

## Level 2

We’ve all seen what happens when someone’s Twitter account gets hacked, we don’t want that to happen to our page.

Require authentication with a login form in order to gain access to add new messages.

## Level 3

Your messages are getting pretty lively, but you’re sending them out all by yourself. What if we made it more fun by inviting some of our friends?

Add the ability to create new accounts allowing others to post messages to their own page.
