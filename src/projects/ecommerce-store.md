# Ecommerce Store

Create an <strong className="color-blue">online store</strong> where you can buy <strong className="color-purple">video games</strong> and <strong className="color-purple">fan gear</strong>.

## Brief

Gone are the times that you need to find a local game store to get the latest Halo release. Instead, you can get any game you want, and some sweet gear, right on the internet.

## Level 1

For someone to be able to purchase a game, they need to be able to find it on your website.

Create a website that includes pictures and names of some video games and fan gear.

## Level 2

Managing inventory and the products in a store is a pain if you have to update code every time. We can use tools like content management systems to dynamically add products.

Integrate a CMS that allows you to manage available products.

## Level 3

In order to purchase a product, weâ€™ll need to provide a way for the customer to pay for it. This includes adding the product to a cart and the checkout process.

Add a cart and payment provider that allows someone to purchase a game.
