# Pokédex

Create a <strong className="color-blue">Pokédex</strong> that shows a list of all <strong className="color-purple">Pokémon</strong> with links to <strong className="color-purple">stats</strong> of each <strong className="color-purple">Pokémon</strong>.

## Brief

If you’re on your journey to be a Pokémon master, nothing is going to be more useful than a Pokédex that allows you to identify and learn more about each Pokémon.

## Level 1

Being able to identify a Pokémon is the first step to understanding more about that Pokémon.

Create a list of Pokémon that shows the name of each Pokémon along with a picture for identification.

## Level 2

If we can only get the first page of a long list of Pokémon, we only have limited knowledge about each one.

Create a Load More button that makes a request to the next page of results in the API.

## Level 3

After learning the name of a Pokémon, the next step is to find out more about that Pokémon like what type of Pokêmon it is and stats.

Create a new page for each Pokémon that’s linked to from the index and includes the basic attributes of each Pokémon.
