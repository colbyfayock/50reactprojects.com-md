Create a <strong className="color-blue">space invaders</strong> spacecraft shooter game to shoot multiple waves of <strong className="color-purple">enemy ships</strong>.

## Brief

Space Invaders is an arcade classic that puts you in a spacecraft up against an alien invasion. As you try to shoot them down, they’re firing back, and you only have a limited amount of protection before you’re open to being hit.

## Level 1

The core part of the game is that you’re moving around a spacecraft trying to hit a bunch of aliens with your weapons. While there’s one of you, there’s many of them.

Create a spacecraft that can move around and shoot aliens that are not moving.

## Level 2

What makes the game tricky, is that the aliens are constantly moving. Every time they hit the edge of the play area, they drop down and speed up getting closer to your ship.

Add movement to the aliens going side to side on the play area. Every time the aliens reach one side they should drop down a level. They should also speed up at certain intervals.

## Level 3

You’re on your own, but luckily you can get some protection. You have shields that you can hide behind that help protect you while they last.

Create several shields in front of the player spacecraft that can take a limited amount of damage.
